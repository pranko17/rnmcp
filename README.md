# react-native-mcp-kit

**See, drive, and debug a running React Native app from an AI agent — or from any other MCP client.**

`react-native-mcp-kit` connects a running RN app (on simulator, emulator, or physical device) to any process that speaks the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io). You wrap your app in one provider, add a babel plugin, point your AI tool at a small Node server that ships with the package, and every interesting thing inside the app becomes addressable: component trees, navigation state, network traffic, React Query cache, logs, errors, translations, storage — plus the OS gesture pipeline (taps, swipes, text input, screenshots) via a bundled binary that needs no WebDriverAgent or idb.

```
AI Agent / Cursor / Claude Code --stdio/MCP--> Node server --WebSocket--> RN app (device)
                                                    │
                                                    └─ host tools (adb / xcrun / ios-hid) --USB/sim--> device
```

## Why would I want this?

A few concrete scenarios this unlocks:

- **End-to-end automation without a separate test harness.** Describe a multi-step flow in natural language — "sign in, open settings, flip the notifications toggle, verify the confirmation toast" — and an agent walks it: locates components by name/testID, fires real taps through the OS gesture pipeline, asserts on the resulting state, and reports back. The same flow works as a scripted smoke test driven by any MCP client.
- **Interactive inspection of a live app from your editor.** Ask "what screen am I on?", "what React Query keys are stale?", "what did the last POST return?", "which translation keys are missing in the current locale?" — no rebuild, no DevTools panel, no "add more logs and reload" loop.
- **Debug gesture-arbitration bugs that unit tests can't catch.** `host__tap` goes through the real iOS/Android touch pipeline, so issues like "the close button inside a horizontally-scrolling list swallows taps" surface naturally. `fiber_tree__invoke` bypasses the pipeline for the rare cases you want to call `onPress` directly.
- **Write your own tools from inside components.** `useMcpTool`/`useMcpState`/`useMcpModule` let a component expose a named state key or an ad-hoc tool. Agents can then read feature-flag state, force a particular loading scenario, or trigger an internal-only action without you shipping a debug menu.

Everything the library adds to your bundle is stripped in production builds via the companion babel plugin — so you can wire it up once and leave it in, without shipping it to users.

## Install

```bash
yarn add react-native-mcp-kit
# or
npm install react-native-mcp-kit
```

**Peer dependencies**: `react >= 19`, `react-native >= 0.79`, `react-native-device-info >= 10`.

## Setup

Three pieces need to be wired up: the **provider** at the root of your RN app, a pair of **babel plugins** so components are identifiable and production builds stay clean, and the **MCP server** that the AI agent talks to.

### 1. Wrap the app in `McpProvider`

Put it at the root of the tree. Optional props opt specific modules in — omit a prop and that module isn't registered.

```tsx
import { NavigationContainer, createNavigationContainerRef } from '@react-navigation/native';
import { McpProvider } from 'react-native-mcp-kit';

const navigationRef = createNavigationContainerRef();

export const App = () => {
  return (
    <McpProvider
      debug
      // Optional — each prop opts a module in:
      navigationRef={navigationRef} // → navigation module
      queryClient={queryClient} // → reactQuery module
      i18n={i18nInstance} // → i18next module
      storages={[{ name: 'mmkv', adapter: mmkvAdapter }]} // → storage module
    >
      <NavigationContainer ref={navigationRef}>{/* your app */}</NavigationContainer>
    </McpProvider>
  );
};
```

These modules register automatically on mount — no prop required:

`alert`, `console`, `device`, `errors`, `network`, `fiber_tree`

If the dependency lives deeper in the tree (e.g. the `QueryClient` is created inside a feature-specific provider), skip the prop and use `useMcpModule` there instead — see [Hooks](#hooks).

### 2. Babel plugins — why and how

Two plugins ship under `react-native-mcp-kit/babel`. You want both.

**`test-id-plugin`** — compiles every capitalized JSX element with a stable `data-mcp-id="ComponentName:path/to/file:line"` attribute. `fiber_tree` uses this attribute as an identifier that survives renders, minification, and refactors. Without the plugin you can still find components by `name` or `testID`, but mcpId is what makes "find the nth occurrence of `ComponentName` on a specific line" reliable across a large codebase. Run this in **development**.

**`strip-plugin`** — strips every trace of mcp-kit from a bundle: imports from `react-native-mcp-kit`, calls to `McpClient.*` / `useMcpState` / `useMcpTool` / `useMcpModule`, the `<McpProvider>` JSX wrapper (its children are preserved), and every `data-mcp-id` attribute. Run this in **production** and none of the library code reaches your users.

```js
// babel.config.js
module.exports = (api) => {
  return {
    presets: ['module:@react-native/babel-preset'],
    plugins: [
      __DEV__
        ? 'react-native-mcp-kit/babel/test-id-plugin'
        : 'react-native-mcp-kit/babel/strip-plugin',
    ],
  };
};
```

Both plugins accept options (attribute name, include/exclude lists, extra import sources, extra function names to strip) when you need to customize — pass them as the 2nd array element in the usual babel style. Defaults cover the common case.

After editing `babel.config.js`, clear Metro's cache once: `yarn start --reset-cache`.

### 3. Configure the MCP server

The MCP server is a Node process that brokers between your agent (stdio/MCP) and the RN app (WebSocket). It ships as a bin in the package — `npx react-native-mcp-kit` boots it.

Point your agent at it via the usual MCP config. For Claude Code / Cursor / Continue etc., a project-local `.mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "react-native-mcp-kit": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["react-native-mcp-kit"]
    }
  }
}
```

**CLI flags:**

- `--port <number>` — WebSocket port the RN app connects to (default `8347`).
- `--no-host` — disable the host module (the server no longer exposes `host__tap`, `host__screenshot`, etc.). Use this when you only want in-app modules.

For **Android emulators** you need the adb port forward so the app can reach the server:

```bash
adb reverse tcp:8347 tcp:8347
```

iOS simulators share localhost with the host machine, no forwarding needed.

### 4. Run

Start Metro + your app. The `McpProvider` connects to `ws://localhost:8347` on mount. The agent calls `connection_status` to confirm; after that every tool is callable.

## `McpProvider` reference

```ts
interface McpProviderProps {
  children: ReactNode;
  debug?: boolean; // colored console logs for all MCP traffic
  navigationRef?: NavigationRef; // → navigationModule
  queryClient?: QueryClientLike; // → reactQueryModule
  i18n?: I18nLike; // → i18nextModule
  storages?: NamedStorage[]; // → storageModule(...storages)
  modules?: McpModule[]; // arbitrary extra modules
}
```

Wrap your whole app in it — every optional prop opts a module in when supplied.

## MCP server tools

The Node server itself exposes a small set of entry-point tools for agents: discovering connected clients, browsing what they can do, reading state exposed via `useMcpState`, and dispatching any in-app tool through `call`. Agents see these straight through the MCP interface; you don't register or configure anything on your side.

## Multi-client

One server can hold multiple RN clients at once — iOS simulator, Android emulator, physical device, any mix. Useful for driving iOS and Android builds of the same app in lockstep from a single agent session.

## Host tools (device-level control)

When the `host` module is enabled (the default), the server also exposes tools that operate **on the host machine** — they run `adb` / `xcrun simctl` / a bundled `ios-hid` binary. These work even when the RN app is frozen, not launched yet, or between reloads.

What you get:

- **Real OS input** — tap, swipe, type, press semantic keys. Goes through the real iOS/Android touch pipeline, so Pressable feedback, gesture responders, and hit testing all run as if a human touched the device.
- **Screenshots** with automatic diffing — the server returns `unchanged:true` when the screen hasn't changed since the last capture, so polling is cheap.
- **App lifecycle** — launch, terminate, restart an installed app. Useful for cold-start assertions or recovering from a crashed state without clicking the simulator.
- **Device enumeration** — list all visible simulators / emulators / devices, annotated with which ones have a live MCP client.

iOS input goes through a bundled `ios-hid` Swift binary. **No WebDriverAgent, no idb, no Appium server.**

## Hooks

For when the thing you want to expose lives deeper than `McpProvider`:

```ts
useMcpState(key, factory, deps)    // expose reactive state to the agent
useMcpTool(name, factory, deps)    // register an ad-hoc tool tied to the component lifecycle
useMcpModule(factory, deps)        // register a whole module from inside a component
```

Each follows `useMemo` / `useEffect` semantics — the factory re-runs on dep changes, registration cleans up on unmount.

```tsx
const UserProvider = ({ children }) => {
  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);

  useMcpState('user', () => ({ id: user?.id, loggedIn: user !== null }), [user]);

  useMcpTool('logout', () => ({
    description: 'Log out the current user',
    handler: async () => { await logout(); return { success: true }; },
  }), [logout]);

  return <UserContext.Provider value={user}>{children}</UserContext.Provider>;
};
```

## Modules

| Module                    | Factory                         | Requires                                  |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| [alert](#alert)           | `alertModule()`                 | —                                         |
| [console](#console)       | `consoleModule(options?)`       | —                                         |
| [device](#device)         | `deviceModule()`                | —                                         |
| [errors](#errors)         | `errorsModule(options?)`        | —                                         |
| [fiber_tree](#fiber_tree) | `fiberTreeModule({ rootRef })`  | root ref (auto-supplied by `McpProvider`) |
| [i18n](#i18n)             | `i18nextModule(i18n)`           | i18next instance                          |
| [navigation](#navigation) | `navigationModule(ref)`         | React Navigation ref                      |
| [network](#network)       | `networkModule(options?)`       | —                                         |
| [query](#query)           | `reactQueryModule(queryClient)` | `QueryClient`                             |
| [storage](#storage)       | `storageModule(...storages)`    | one or more `NamedStorage`                |

The full tool list for every module is always available via `list_tools` at runtime — the sections below describe what each module gives you, not each tool.

### alert

Show a native `Alert.alert` from the agent with any combination of `default` / `cancel` / `destructive` buttons and get back which one was pressed. Useful for "are you sure?" prompts driven by the agent, or for surfacing a decision point to a human tester.

### console

Tails `console.log` / `warn` / `error` / `info` / `debug` into a ring buffer the agent can read or clear. Complex values (Errors, Dates, class instances, cyclic refs, functions, Symbols) are serialized safely. Buffer size, captured levels, and whether stack traces are collected are all configurable.

```ts
consoleModule({
  maxEntries: 200,
  levels: ['error', 'warn', 'log'],
  stackTrace: ['error', 'warn'], // or `true` / `false`
});
```

### device

Read-only view of platform facts (OS, version, dimensions in DP and physical pixels, pixel ratio, appearance, app state, accessibility settings, keyboard state) plus a few imperative actions — open URLs / settings, dismiss the keyboard, vibrate, reload the JS bundle in dev.

### errors

Captures unhandled JS errors (via `ErrorUtils.setGlobalHandler`) and unhandled promise rejections with deduplication, so the agent can inspect what crashed without tailing native logs.

### fiber_tree

The heart of UI inspection. The agent walks the component tree, finds elements by name / testID / text / which callback props they have, reads their props, calls their ref methods, and invokes arbitrary callbacks on them. Coordinates it returns (`bounds`) are in physical pixels and pair directly with `host__tap` / `host__swipe`.

### i18n

Inspect and manipulate an `i18next` instance: list keys, dump a whole translation resource, run a substring search, translate with interpolation, switch language at runtime.

### navigation

Drive React Navigation from outside — navigate, push, pop, replace, reset — and read the current route, nested state, and the last 100 transitions with timestamps. Needs a `createNavigationContainerRef()` passed to both `<NavigationContainer ref={…}>` and `<McpProvider navigationRef={…}>` (or `navigationModule(ref)` directly).

### network

Intercepts `fetch` and `XMLHttpRequest` into a ring buffer — method, URL, status, duration, headers, bodies. The agent can list recent traffic, filter by method/status/URL, find a request by URL substring, see what's in flight, or just the failures. WebSocket, Metro, and symbolicate traffic are auto-ignored.

```ts
networkModule({
  maxEntries: 200,
  includeBodies: true,
  ignoreUrls: ['https://analytics.example.com', /\.png$/],
});
```

### query

React Query cache inspection: list cached queries, fetch cached data by key, get stats, and run `invalidate` / `refetch` / `remove` / `reset` against specific keys or the whole cache.

### storage

Reads and writes to one or more named key-value stores. Each store is a `{ name, adapter }` pair; the adapter can wrap MMKV, AsyncStorage, or any custom implementation that provides at least a `get`:

```ts
interface StorageAdapter {
  get(key: string): string | undefined | null | Promise<string | undefined | null>;
  set?(key: string, value: string): void | Promise<void>;
  delete?(key: string): void | Promise<void>;
  getAllKeys?(): string[] | Promise<string[]>;
}

storageModule(
  { name: 'mmkv', adapter: mmkvAdapter },
  { name: 'async', adapter: asyncStorageAdapter }
);
```

Without an `adapter.set` / `delete` / `getAllKeys`, the corresponding tools just report the operation as unsupported.

## Custom modules

Write your own module by returning an `McpModule`:

```ts
import { type McpModule } from 'react-native-mcp-kit';

const myModule = (): McpModule => ({
  name: 'myModule',
  description: 'Custom tools exposed to AI agents',
  tools: {
    greet: {
      description: 'Returns a greeting',
      handler: async (args) => ({ message: `Hello, ${args.name}!` }),
      inputSchema: { name: { type: 'string' } },
      timeout: 5000, // optional per-tool timeout, default 10s
    },
  },
});

<McpProvider modules={[myModule()]}>{…}</McpProvider>
// or
useMcpModule(() => myModule(), []);
```

Agents see the module + its tools in `list_tools` and call them via `call(tool: "myModule__greet")`.

## Dev vs production

- **Development** — test-id plugin on, strip plugin off. The `McpProvider` boots, tries to connect to `ws://localhost:8347`; if the server isn't running, no harm done — the bridge just stays disconnected and retries.
- **Production** — strip plugin on (test-id plugin off). The provider, all hook calls, every import from `react-native-mcp-kit`, and every `data-mcp-id` attribute vanish from the bundle. Nothing ships to users.

You don't need `if (__DEV__)` guards around mcp-kit usage — the babel plugin handles it.

## Debug logging

Pass `debug` to the provider to print every incoming request and outgoing response with color-coded module names and arrows. Logs use the pre-intercept `console.log`, so they never pollute the `console` module's buffer.

```tsx
<McpProvider debug>{…}</McpProvider>
```

## Local development (symlink / portal)

If you're developing the library next to an app and symlinking it in, Metro needs to know about the extra path:

```js
// metro.config.js
const path = require('path');
const mcpPath = path.resolve(__dirname, '../path-to/react-native-mcp-kit');

module.exports = {
  watchFolders: [mcpPath],
  resolver: {
    nodeModulesPaths: [
      path.resolve(__dirname, 'node_modules'),
      path.resolve(mcpPath, 'node_modules'),
    ],
  },
};
```

## API reference

The recommended entry point is `<McpProvider />` — it owns the client singleton and you rarely need to touch `McpClient` directly. For advanced cases the class exposes `McpClient.initialize` / `getInstance` / `registerModule(s)` / `registerTool` / `setState` / `removeState` / `dispose` / `enableDebug` (all idempotent, `initialize` returns the existing instance on repeat calls).

Module and tool types:

```ts
interface McpModule {
  name: string;
  description?: string;
  tools: Record<string, ToolHandler>;
}

interface ToolHandler {
  description: string;
  handler: (args: Record<string, unknown>) => unknown | Promise<unknown>;
  inputSchema?: Record<string, unknown>;
  timeout?: number; // default 10s
}
```
